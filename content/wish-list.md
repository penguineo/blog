## Ideas

### Scratch Pad (Ideas)

#### Considered

1. Learn Fuzz testing in go.
2. Learn DSA.
3. Ansible setup for replicating arch linux setup.
4. Adding script for fuzzy searching in some of the GitHub commands.

#### Dumb

- I want to build a repository that contains all my other repositories of building things from scratch.

- I should start content creation as a hobby. It'll take quite a bit of time to get started.
  - Start reading documentation live in front of audience on multiple platforms or on twitch and edit and post it on YouTube or might just do on both.
  - Ofcourse I'll write blog also but I'll do it live if I need to do any update or I might not.
- Need something to add to my hobby list because I'm bored.

- Build my own terminal emulator.
- Build my own kernel.
- Build a code editor.
- Build a compiler.
- Build an interpreter.
