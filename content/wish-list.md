## Ideas

### Scratch Pad (Ideas)

1. I should start content creation as a hobby. It'll take quite a bit of time to get started.
    - Start reading documentation live in front of audience on multiple platforms or on twitch and edit and post it on YouTube or might just do on both.
    - Ofcourse I'll write blog also but I'll do it live if I need to do any update or I might not.

- I want to build a repository that contains all my other repositories of building things from scratch.
