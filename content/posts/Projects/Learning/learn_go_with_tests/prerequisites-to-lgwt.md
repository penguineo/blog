## Introduction

Golang is a pretty easy, simple and boring language.
Easy to learn, simple to build applications and boring to prevent procrastination with complex OOP concepts.
Yes, Golang doesn't have object oriented programming.
It wants to be a modern "C" like language.
While scavenging where to learn Go from, I came across [**Learn Go with Test**](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/go-fundamentals/hello-world)
which fits all of the basics of Go as well as testing (essential for building reliable applications).

## Pre-requisites for "Learn Go with tests"

1. **Basic Programming Knowledge**
You should be comfortable with foundational concepts like:
- Variables
- Constants
- Data types
- Conditionals (such as: `If Else`, `Switch Case`)
- Loops ( such as `For` loops)
- Functions

2. Familiarity with Go's syntax.
You should already know how Go code looks like and some of the common rules.
This is to ensure that you're not surprised by seeing this,
```go
func someFunction(someArgs string)(returnsSomeInteger int){
    //does something
    return
}
```

3. Experience with Go's command line tools
Go is very [command line](/content/posts/Operating-Systems/User-Interfaces/cli-vs-tui-vs-gui.md) friendly!
You should know the basics of using commands like `go run`,`go build`,`go test` to run, compile and test your code.

4. Understanding of Go's modules and package system.
Go organizes code into modules and packages.
You don't need to be an expert but knowing how to create, import and use packages will make things much easier.

5. Familiarity with a code editor.
Whether you use Bloat(VS Code or any other IDE) or vim etc, it's helpful to be comfortable with basic code editing.
And installing the right plugins for Go to make writing and testing code smoother.
